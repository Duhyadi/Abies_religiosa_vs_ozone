# GENERAL README

This is the repository to describe my project and my particular aims of my MasterÂ´s Thesis.

The principal aim of my project is : **Assess whether the tolerance of sacred fir (Abies religiosa) to exposure by O3, in a peripheral forest of the CDMX, is related to the genetic origin of the individuals or is given by differential expression of candidate genes.**

But my particular aims:

* Evaluate the differential expression of healthy and damaged trees in two periods of [O3].
* Identify origins of sacred fir with tolerance to O3.
* Quantify the relative abundance of secondary metabolites in healthy y damaged trees in two periods of concentration of O3

To fulfill them I have a one directory for each one.

# Each one of the last directories have inside:

`/bin`

This is a directory. It contains the scripts and html files results of the scripts.

```/data
``` 

This is a directory. It contains a screenshot of my data, because the real data is very heavy. 

`/metadata`

This is a directory. It contains .csv, .txt and other files non product of scripts.

`/outputs`

This is a directory. It contains files product of the scripts.

`/README`

This is a markdown file. It is a description file particular of this section.

`/Discussion and conclusion`

This is a markdown file. It is a discussion particular of this section.
