# GENERAL README

This is the repository to describe my project and do my particular aims of my MasterÂ´s Thesis.

The principal aim of my project is : **Assess whether the tolerance of sacred fir (Abies religiosa) to exposure by O3, in a peripheral forest of the CDMX, is related to the genetic origin of the individuals or is given by differential expression of candidate genes.**

But my particular aims:

* Evaluate the differential expression of healthy and damaged trees in two periods of [O3].
* Identify origins of sacred fir with tolerance to O3.
* Quantify the relative abundance of secondary metabolites in healthy y damaged trees in two periods of concentration of O3

To fulfill them I have a one directory for each one.

There are three directories. Each one have a data, scripts and some results.
