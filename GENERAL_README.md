# Analysis_README

This is the repository to describe my project and my particular aims of my MasterÂ´s Thesis.

The principal aim of my project is : **Assess if the tolerance of sacred fir (Abies religiosa) to exposure by O3, in a peripheral forest of the CDMX, is related to the genetic origin of the individuals or is given by differential expression of candidate genes.**

To resolves my general aim, I have 3 particular aims. The analyzes to answer each aim have a particular directory with data  and pictures:

* Evaluate the differential expression of healthy and damaged trees in two periods of [O3] ([TRANSCRIPTOMICS](https://github.com/VeroIarrachtai/Transcriptomic_Analysis_Abies_religiosa-TB/tree/master/TRANSCRIPTOMICS)).

* Identify origins of sacred fir with tolerance to O3 ([GENOMICS](https://github.com/VeroIarrachtai/Transcriptomic_Analysis_Abies_religiosa-TB/tree/master/GENOMICS)).

* Quantify the relative abundance of secondary metabolites in healthy y damaged trees in two periods of concentration of O3 ([METABOLOMICS](https://github.com/VeroIarrachtai/Transcriptomic_Analysis_Abies_religiosa-TB/tree/master/METABOLOMICS)).

Each one solves one of my particular aims.

# Each one of the last directories have inside:


:file_folder: **`/bin`**

This is a directory. It contains the scripts and html files results of the scripts.


:file_folder: **`/data`**

This is a directory. It contains a screenshot of my data, because the real data is very heavy. 


:file_folder: **`/metadata`**

This is a directory. It contains .csv, .txt and other files to do the analysis.


:file_folder: **`/outputs`**

This is a directory. It contains files product of the scripts.

:page_facing_up: **`/README.md`**

This is a markdown file. It is a description file particular of this directory and analysis.
