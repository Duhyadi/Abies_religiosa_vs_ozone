# ABSTRACT: Transcriptomic analysis about tropospheric ozone tolerance in *Abies religiosa*.

## by Reyes-Galindo Verónica

Urbanization modifies the ecosystems original conditions and affects the evolution of the species that inhabit cities. In particular, air pollution by tropospheric ozone (O3) caused the decline of sacred fir (Abies religiosa) in peripheral areas of Mexico City (CDMX). Recently, sacred fir individuals with less damage were detected within an exposure area with great fir mortality, suggesting that there is genetic variation within populations that could be related to tolerance to O3 contamination tolerance. In this work we compare healthy and damaged trees within the same exposure area using histological, metabolomic, genomic and transcriptomic analyses. For this, tissue was collected from healthy and damaged individuals during a day of high (170ppb) and another of low (87ppb) O3 concentration. The histological sections evidenced gradual damage at the structural level, mainly in the parenchyma in palisade, in addition to showing accumulation of phenolic compounds. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CG-MS) revealed the differential presence of ß-Pineno, L-α-Bornyl Acetate, ß-Caryophylene Oxide, α-Caryophylene, ß-Cubebeno, α-Cubebeno and α-Muurolene, between healthy and damaged individuals; compounds that have already been associated with O3 metabolism in other studies. GBS data (1,550 SNPs) was used to identify the individual ancestry (local, introduced by reforestation). Finally, the transcriptomic analysis showed differential expression, revealing seven candidate genes associated with carbohydrate and flavonoid metabolic pathways. These results open the door to urban evolution studies to identify germplasm with greater tolerance to O3 contamination that facilitate the establishment of more successful reforestation programs in the peripheral forests of the CDMX.
