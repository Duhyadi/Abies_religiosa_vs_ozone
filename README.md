# Abies_religiosa_vs_ozone

:evergreen_tree: I am Veronica Reyes Galindo. This repository contains all the scripts of my Master's Thesis project at [Instituto de Ecología, UNAM](http://www.ecologia.unam.mx/).:evergreen_tree:

* The online version of my Thesis is in [UNAM]() website.

* You can found "The paper" and other files about my project in [my ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Veronica_Reyes-Galindo).

* If you want  to know more about the importance of the project to reforest the forest near to Mexico city, you can see a nice [video](https://twitter.com/ChilangoCom/status/1028999361722761217?s=04&fbclid=IwAR2AF-Tfj_Uudgl_M0vbpxONYGhOTdIdeaDG6xD4VrQg_SFvUOPqDbJt1Uk) and read a [report](https://www.chilango.com/noticias/reportajes/desierto-de-los-leones-agoniza/amp/?__twitter_impression=true&fbclid=IwAR1kObOZYXBEytAUHqsL3OzTa3jTfeaXs8VtBfaao4tK0LjgGhIM1YAYlfE) in spanish by "Chilango" magazine.

And please send me a message in **veronica.rg.pb@ gmail.com** to clear all doubts about my Master's Thesis project. :smiley:

**You should continue reading [Analysis_README](https://github.com/VeroIarrachtai/Abies_religiosa_vs_ozone/blob/master/Analysis_README.md) to better understand this repository and differents workflows of my project.** :wink:

**FINALLY** Welcome to my repository!!!! :tada: :confetti_ball:

This is the repository that describes my project and the particular aims of my Master´s Thesis.

The principal aim of my project is to : **Assess if the tolerance of sacred fir (Abies religiosa) to exposure by O3, in a peripheral forest of the CDMX, is related to the genetic origin of the individuals or is given by differential expression of candidate genes.**

To resolves my general aim, I have 3 particular aims. The analyzes to answer each aim can be found in separate directories with data  and pictures:

* Evaluate the differential expression of healthy and damaged trees in two periods of [O3] ([TRANSCRIPTOMICS](https://github.com/VeroIarrachtai/Abies_religiosa_vs_ozone/tree/master/TRANSCRIPTOMICS)).

* Identify origins of sacred fir with tolerance to O3 ([GENOMICS](https://github.com/VeroIarrachtai/Abies_religiosa_vs_ozone/tree/master/GENOMICS)).

* Quantify the relative abundance of secondary metabolites in healthy y damaged trees in two periods of concentration of O3 ([METABOLOMICS](https://github.com/VeroIarrachtai/Abies_religiosa_vs_ozone/tree/master/METABOLOMICS)).

:file_folder: **`/TRANSCRIPTOMICS`** **`/GENOMICS`** **`/METABOLOMICS`**

Three directories: [TRANSCRIPTOMICS](https://github.com/VeroIarrachtai/Abies_religiosa_vs_ozone/tree/master/TRANSCRIPTOMICS), [GENOMICS](https://github.com/VeroIarrachtai/Abies_religiosa_vs_ozone/tree/master/GENOMICS) and [METABOLOMICS](https://github.com/VeroIarrachtai/Abies_religiosa_vs_ozone/tree/master/METABOLOMICS). Each one solves one of my particular aims.

# TRANSCRIPTOMICS

### Evaluate the differential expression of healthy and damaged trees in two periods of [O3].

# Each one of these directories have inside:


:file_folder: **`/bin`**

This is a directory. It contains the scripts and html files results of the scripts.


:file_folder: **`/data`**

This is a directory. It contains a screenshot of my data, because the real data is very heavy.


:file_folder: **`/metadata`**

This is a directory. It contains .csv, .txt and other files to do the analysis.


:file_folder: **`/outputs`**

This is a directory. It contains files product of the scripts.

:page_facing_up: **`/README.md`**

This is a markdown file. It is a description file particular of this directory and analysis.

:page_facing_up: **`/Discussion and conclusion.md`**

This is a markdown file. It is a discussion particular of this section.
